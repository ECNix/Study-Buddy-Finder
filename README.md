# About This Project
This project was assigned in my Software Engineering II class and lasted all semester. On the last day of class, each group presented their project to the mentors, our professor, and the other groups. It involved making a website which facilitated the creation of study sessions

# My Role and Contributions
Our group was divided by into the following roles:
- Project Leader
- Quality Assurance Engineer
- Design Manager
- Requirements Engineer
- Librarian

I was the requirements engineer, and found myself quite suited to the position. We were given a handout with specific milestones each week to present in a scrum meeting and it was my role in the group to help the project manager make sure that we finished everything we needed to in time. I also gained clarification from our mentors as to what certain requirements entailed whenever necessary.

This project was designed to run on the Google Cloud Platform, and I was the first of my teammates to set that up appropriately. We struggled to maintain it a few times, and resorted to trying other accounts to run the project on, but for the majority of the semester, including the beginning and the end of it, the project was run on a vm which existed on my account and which I would ssh into to debug.

# Takeaways
This project taught me a great deal. This had been the first time since high school that I attempted any sort of web development, and that was when people used ajax requests instead of axios. I learned a great deal about React during this course. Obviously, Next.js is used in this project, but this course also gave us the opportunity to use pure React. Of the two, I prefer the latter. I'd have to do some initial Googling and perhaps reference this project to use React again as it's been a moment since I've done web development using JS, but I am comfortable with its concepts.

This was also a wonderful opportunity to design SQL tables for a larger system. Another project of mine, Total Planner (which exists as a repository on this account), was my first foray into practical use of SQL. Here, during the course which I took at the same time as my Database Design class, I was able to put into further my experience gained from that project. I also took software engineering II concurrently with Database Designe and Management, and Study Buddy Finder was an excellent opportunity to put some of skills I learned there into practice.

This is my first and only experience with a cloud platform. While I confess to limited knowledge of the tool, it exposed me to a some of its functionality and I would feel comfortable learning any related skills on the job.

One thing which I learned from this project that I did not anticipate was learning to work directly with clients. Our mentors took the role of clients which we met with each week. I recall one particular point of contention wherein we wanted to make it possible for an account to be both a student and a tutor. However, according to the milestones, we had to demonstrate logging in both a
