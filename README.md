## 1. study-buddy-api: Backend Setup

 - Install IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition (you can use your student email to get a free license for this): https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=mac
 - Install Java 16(OpenJDK)
 - Install Docker:
   - Windows:
     - Go this link: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/
     - Choose **Hyper-V backend and Windows containers** to install docker
     - For installation, you can follow this tutorial as well
			  **(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9AWYlt86B8&t=251s)**
   - Mac:
     - Go to this link: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/
     - Choose **Mac with Intel chip** or **Mac with Apple chip** depending on your specific machine

 - Setup Project in IntelliJ
   - Import the project at the study-buddy-finder parent dir (root of repository) into IntelliJ using existing sources
   - Import the inner study-buddy-api subdirectory
     1. Go File > Project Structure > Modules > + > Import Module
     2. For this, choose to import using external model with Gradle
     3. IntelliJ should autodetect your Gradle project and download dependencies
   - Configure Lombok
     - Install Lombok Plugin for IntelliJ (IntelliJ IDEA > Preferences > Plugins ... Search for "Lombok" by Michail Plushnikov)
     - Enable Annotation Processing in IntelliJ Compliation (IntelliJ IDEA > Preferences > Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler > Annotation Processors > Check "Enable annotation processing")
 - Deploy MySQL: https://medium.com/containerum/how-to-deploy-mysql-in-docker-containers-ba870247eff7
   - From IntelliJ, create the default study-buddy-finder database on the server: File > New > Data Source > Mysql. _Note: if you are not using IntelliJ Ultimate, you will not have this option. Either swap to IntelliJ Ultimate or manually create the database via the MySQL console that you open using the "Deploy MySQL" link above._
     1. Configure the connection:
        - Name: RTP - Local
        - Host: localhost
        - Port: 3306
        - User: root
        - Password: password
     2. Test Connection and hit OK
     3. On the right-hand side of IntelliJ, click on the "Database" tab
     4. For the study-buddy-finder database, right click and navigate to New > Schema
     5. Add a new database named study-buddy-finder and hit OK
        - If you encounter an error, try watching this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ra-FOOHjD2s
 - Startup the API from IntelliJ SpringBoot Run Configuration
   - Specify VM Options
     `-Dspring.profiles.active=development`
 - Navigate to http://localhost:8080/ping
   - You should see the following output:
     - GET localhost:8080/ping
     - **pong!**

## 2. study-buddy-frontend: Frontend Setup

 - Install VSCode: https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
 - Install Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
 - In the terminal, navigate to the study-buddy-frontend directory and run the following commands:
   - `npm init`
   - `npm install --location=global yarn`
   - **(Windows PowerShell only)** `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted`
   - Check yarn version: `yarn â€“version`
   - `yarn install`
   - Finally: `yarn dev`
 - Navigate to http://localhost:3000 - you should see the study buddy application

## 3. CI/CD Setup
-	Setup an account with GCP if you don't already have one.
-	Create a Linux VM in GCP: This will be your production server.
    - Enable the Compute Engine API, and create a Linux VM Instance under that resource.
    -	Check the options for allowing both HTTP and HTTPS traffic to the VM. This should give your VM an external IP address once it's created.
- Navigate to the "VM instances" tab and click the "Set up firewall rules" option.
    -	Select the "default-allow-http" rule, and select "Edit" at the top of the page.
    -	In the "TCP Ports" section, add 8080 and 3000. This will allow you to access those ports from your local machine. If, in the future, you need to add more or different HTTP ports, you would do so in the same way. Also, if you want to add HTTPS ports, you would do so in the same way, just under the "default-allow-https" rule.
- Setup a GitHub runner: The GitHub runner waits for commits to be made to the branch it is configured to watch and runs a user-defined set of commands when one occurs. This runner must be linked to your repository first.
    -	Open an SSH terminal to your VM in GCP
    -	Install a GitHub self-hosted runner on the VM using the instructions found by navigating in your GitHub Repository from: Settings > Actions > Runners > New self-hosted runner. Follow the "Download" and "Configure" instructions **EXCEPT FOR THE `./run.sh` COMMAND**.
    -	Install docker on your VM, using the following instructions (using the repository): https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/#install-using-the-repository 
    -	Run the following command, giving your GitHub runner permissions to run docker commands: `sudo usermod -aG docker <my-username>` (`<my-username>` is the username that you used to log in via SSH to the VM).
    -	To check if `<my-username>` has access to Docker run: `sudo -u <my-username> -H docker info`. This command will fail if that user does not have permission.
    -	Finally, configure your GitHub runner to run as a service in the background and automatically restart if it crashes. Run `sudo ./svc.sh install` and `sudo ./svc.sh start`. After you deploy your project, you can check the status by running: `sudo ./svc.sh status`. More Info: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/configuring-the-self-hosted-runner-application-as-a-service.
-	Write a GitHub Actions workflow (CI pipeline) file.
    -	This file tells the GitHub runner what to do whenever a commit is made to the branch the file is in; You can learn more here: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart
    -	We want our runner to build a docker image for both our frontend and backend on a commit and then deploy those images as containers, along with our database image, to our production server. The way this is done is largely up to you; we have provided sample Dockerfiles and a sample GitHub actions workflow file (`sample-github-actions-ci.yml`) to give an example of how it could be achieved. You need to move them to the correct folders to make them work (see more in the `sample-github-actions-ci.yml` file).
    -	Whenever a commit is made, a workflow should be created for your GitHub project. You can view this workflow to see its status while it is executing in the "Actions" tab on GitHub.
    -	To learn more about how to create and run a Docker image from a GitHub Actions workflow, see: https://linuxhit.com/how-to-create-docker-images-with-github-actions/ or https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-docker-container-action

This will get basic CI/CD functionality setup for your project. Feel free to customize this process to fit your needs as the project progresses. Note that one of your project deliverables will be extending the CI/CD to also support running automated tests.
