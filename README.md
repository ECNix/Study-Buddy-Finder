# What is Study Buddy Finder?
This project was assigned in my Software Engineering II class and lasted all semester. On the last day of class, each group presented their project to the mentors, our professor, and the other groups. It involved making a website which facilitated the creation of study sessions with or without tutors as specified. It uses a React frontend and a Java backend. We managed to run it using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and 

## My Role and Contributions
Our group was divided by into the following roles:
- Project Leader
- Quality Assurance Engineer
- Design Manager
- Requirements Engineer
- Librarian

I was the requirements engineer, and found myself quite suited to the position. We were given a handout with specific milestones each week to present in a scrum meeting and it was my role in the group to help the project manager make sure that we finished everything we needed to in time. I also gained clarification from our mentors as to what certain requirements entailed whenever necessary.

As I mentioned earlier, this project was designed to run on the GCP, and I was the first of my teammates to set that up appropriately. We struggled to maintain it a few times, and resorted to trying other accounts to run the project on, but for the majority of the semester, including the beginning and the end of it, the project was run on a vm which existed on my account and which I would ssh into to debug.

The most substantial of my contributions was the impelentation of almost everything to do with sessions. I was responsible for designing them, making every page to interact with them, and writing every function to retrieve or manipulate them through the backend. This included the implementation of notifications, which was orignally someone else's job, but during the week it needed to be done, they were unfortuantely too busy to do so.

Finally, I was also the one who managed to implement local storage using redux so that the user wouldn't be logged out if they reloaded. This made debugging much easier at the final stretch when we had our cybersecurity measures in place and the project was existed at a scale where testing a user story took some effort.

# What Would I do Differently?
There are various flubs our team made as people barely starting junior year of university, so those would need ironing out, as any project would. I would also overhault the front end, since it very much looks like it was designed by computer science majors (Though our UX and navigablity, I would say, was some of the best in the class). Chief amont the redesign would be a color change and a complete redo of how I wrote the notifications page. Overall, though, I'm very proud of how well we did on this project.

# What Did I learn?
This project taught me a great deal. This had been the first time since high school that I attempted any sort of web development, and that was when people used ajax requests instead of axios. I learned a great deal about React during this course. Obviously, Next.js is used in this project, but this course also gave us the opportunity to use pure React. Of the two, I prefer the latter. I'd have to do some initial Googling and perhaps reference this project to use React again as it's been a moment since I've done web development using JS, but I am comfortable with its concepts.

This was also a wonderful opportunity to design SQL tables for a larger system. Another project of mine, Total Planner (which exists as a repository on this account), was my first foray into practical use of SQL. Here, during the course which I took at the same time as my Database Design class, I was able to put into further my experience gained from that project. I also took software engineering II concurrently with Database Designe and Management, and Study Buddy Finder was an excellent opportunity to put some of skills I learned there into practice.

This is my first and only experience with a cloud platform. While I confess to limited knowledge of the tool, it exposed me to a some of its functionality and I would feel comfortable learning any related skills on the job.

One thing which I learned from this project that I did not anticipate was learning to work directly with clients. Our mentors took the role of clients which we met with each week, and there were certainly points of contention as a result. It is an experience which has been invaluable ever since when dealing with any client-like figure.
